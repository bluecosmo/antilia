= Introduction =

This page describes how to get started using Antilia's Wicket components and building your own Antila powered OSGi-wicket applications.

= Details =

For the time being we just describe how to get the couple of demo application we provide. Our demo applications, as Antilia itself, are build as (equinox) OSGI application. So, you will need to use Eclipse as IDE if you want to be able to run the demos as they are now. NOTE: this doesn't imply that some of the component we provide cannot be used in non-OSGi WEB applications.

We provide a application:

==A demo showing how to use Antilia to build Data-base oriented applications==

This application shows Antilia's Data-oriented components: so, far this mean a CRUD component that is capable to generate a complex CRUD panel out of JPA annotated bean and some (optinal) additional information...

In order to get the second application working, you will need to: 

 * Check out the projects:
    # com.antilia.common
    # com.antilia.demo.manager
    # com.antilia.export
    # com.antilia.ext
    # com.antilia.hibernate
    # com.antilia.ibatis
    # com.antilia.web  
 * If you open the Debugs dialog configuration  and you go to the section OSGi Framework, you will find the *manager34* launcher. You can use it to start the application. 
 * Start the application using previous launcher. 
 * Then browse to http:localhost:8080/manager to see the application working. Just use any user=password to login into the application. 

*Note:* This is still work in progress.
