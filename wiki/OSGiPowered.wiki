#summary The full power of OSGi.

= The full power of OSGi =

As our applications run on an OSGi environment (equinox by now) we can use this to make our applications modular. How? Well just to give an example: 

 * By installing the bundle (plug-in) com.antilia.export suddenly all the tables of your application are capable of exporting themselves to PDF, Excel, CSV, etcetera. This is shown in following screen shots:

and

How does this work? 

 * There is a service that allows to register Menu-entries providers. 
 * The export bundle finds that service and registers a provider that knows how to add buttons that know how to export a table to PDF, Excel, etc. 
 * When the table is rendering it ask this service for providers for the top-table menu, hence the export functionality.

Now, lets see this is completely dynamic. If we go to the OSGi console of eclipse and we type the command *ss* we will see something like:

If we them type *stop 19* and so *ss* again we see export bundle is no longer active...
